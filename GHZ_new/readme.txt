The Question is ?? Having a fix k_total what distribution [k_1, k_2, k_3] is optimal for the setting [l_1, l_2, l_3] ??

For a given client distant and resource allocation, how to calculate the final rate >>

ABC_Estimate.m >> find the optimum allocation 
    {
        SecretKey6StateGHZEndToEnd.m >> calculate the six state protocol rate for three links, distributing GHZ states 
            {
                GHZ_InnerOuter.m calculates the logical Z/X error for a given client
